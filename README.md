# Bloggit A Blogs Portal

Bloggit is a blogging and social-networking web application where users can view, share, like blogs. Also, users can chat anonymously with other users by just entering their name.  This service allows users to post images and other content to a short-form blog. Users are able to re-blog and like posts from other blogs that appear on their dashboard. 

Bloggit  allows the user to upload text posts, images, quotes, or links to their blog with ease. Users  can also share their blogs to their Facebook accounts. So, whenever they make a post,  they can also send it as a status update. Users can help their audience find posts about certain topics by adding tags. If someone were to upload a picture to their blog and wanted their viewers to find their blog, they would add the tag, and their viewers could use that word to search for posts with the tag. 

Whether sharing your expertise, breaking news, or whatever’s on your mind, Bloggit helps us to do that with ease. Bloggit allows users to edit their blog's theme HTML coding to control the appearance of their blog.
